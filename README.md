# Railway Reservation System

This is a C++ project for a Railway Reservation System that demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and file handling. The project includes a dynamic seat map, allowing users to reserve seats on a train. It is designed to run in a console environment and provides basic functionality for booking and managing train reservations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Seat Map:** The project provides a dynamic seat map that shows the availability of seats in real-time, helping users choose their preferred seats.
- **File Handling:** Reservation data is stored in files, ensuring data persistence between program runs.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The console interface is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.
- **Multiple Trains:** The system supports multiple trains, each with its own set of seat arrangements.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual C++) installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/railway-reservation-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd railway-reservation-system
   ```

3. Compile the project using your C++ compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o railway_reservation_system
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./railway_reservation_system
   ```

## Usage

1. When you run the program, you will be prompted to select a train from the available options.
2. You can view the seat map, check seat availability, and make reservations as needed.
3. Reservation data will be stored in files for future reference.

## Files and Directories

- `main.cpp`: The main source code for the Railway Reservation System.
- `trainlist/`: This directory contains text files representing different trains, including their seat configurations.
- `passanger/`: This directory stores reservation data in separate text files for each train.
- `id/`: This file contains login details of users.
